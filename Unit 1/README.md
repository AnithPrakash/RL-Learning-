## The Lunar Lander Reinforcement Learning (RL) model is an AI-based approach to train an agent to land a spacecraft in a simulated environment. This model leverages Reinforcement Learning techniques, particularly Deep Q-Networks (DQN), to optimize the landing process.

### Key Concepts:
Reinforcement Learning (RL): A type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving rewards or penalties.

Deep Q-Networks (DQN): A deep learning-based RL algorithm that combines Q-learning with deep neural networks to handle complex environments.

### How It Works:
State Inputs: The agent receives inputs such as position, velocity, angle, and leg contact sensors.

Actions: The agent can take discrete actions like doing nothing, firing the left/right engine, or firing the main engine.

Learning Process: The agent learns by updating its Q-values based on the rewards received from its actions. This process involves experience replay and target networks for stability.

### Training:
The model is trained using reward-based training to enhance landing efficiency.

Hyperparameters are fine-tuned for improved stability and accuracy.

The performance is evaluated using visualized learning curves.

### Results:
The model shows improved landing success rates over episodes.

Visualizations of reward accumulation and model performance are used to assess the training progress.
